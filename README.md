# GemRun

GemRun is an ongoing project under active development. It is a simple Java console game where the player needs to find a hidden gem within a maze-like board. The player can move left or right within the maze to locate the gem.

## Getting Started

To play GemRun, follow these steps:

### 1. Compile the Java File

Ensure you have a Java compiler installed on your system. Compile the `GemRun.java` file using the following command:

javac GemRun.java


### 2. Run the Program

After compiling successfully, run the program using the following command:

java GemRun


### 3. Follow On-Screen Instructions

The program will prompt you to enter positions for the player and the gem. You can either specify positions from 0 to 19 or choose to randomize them by entering -1.

### 4. Play the Game

Once the initial positions are set, the game will start. You'll be prompted to enter "left" or "right" to move the player within the maze. Based on your input, the program will update the player's position and provide feedback on your proximity to the gem.

### 5. Winning the Game

Keep moving until you find the gem. Once the player's position matches the gem's position, the game ends, and you'll see a victory message along with the final board showing the gem's location.

## Gameplay Instructions

- Use the "left" and "right" commands to move the player within the maze.
- Pay attention to the feedback messages indicating how close you are to the gem.
- The game ends when you successfully find the gem.
